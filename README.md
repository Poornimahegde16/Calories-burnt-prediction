This repository explores the prediction of calories burnt during physical activity using various machine learning regression techniques.

Project Goals:
Develop and compare machine learning models for predicting calorie expenditure.
Evaluate the performance of Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and Ridge Regression on a calorie burning dataset.
Identify the most accurate model for predicting calorie burn.

Algorithms Used:
Linear Regression: A baseline model that establishes a linear relationship between features and calorie expenditure.
Lasso Regression: Addresses overfitting in linear regression by introducing L1 regularization, shrinking some feature coefficients to zero.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved prediction accuracy and handling non-linear relationships.
Ridge Regression: Similar to Lasso regression, but uses L2 regularization to penalize large coefficients, reducing variance.

Data:
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on individuals' physical activities, such as heart rate, duration, body weight, and corresponding calorie expenditure. The specific dataset details will be documented in a separate file (e.g., dataset.csv).
